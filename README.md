    python -m venv .

    .\Scripts\activate.bat

Linux | Mac :

    python3 -m venv .

    source ./bin/activate

# Settings

After creating and activating the virtual environment, run *_setup_local.py*, it
will move packages to avoid errors, as well as installing Kivy to the
python3.11 (since it has an installation error via pip), if
have some error and install the requirements.txt

If you want to install dependencies manually:
    
     pip install Cython==0.29.32 Kivy==2.1.0
